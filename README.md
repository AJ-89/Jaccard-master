# Jaccard
This script is based on the clustering approach shown in the following repo: nico/cvbook/hcluster.py
The current state of the script is used to facilitate clustering based on jaccard's similarity. This script was written as a part of a  pilot project and thus the input used in jaccard.py is very specific to my implementation.
